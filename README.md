# QuarterNote

[QuarterNote Live On The Web!](https://quarternote.chat)

QuarterNote is a musical messaging web platform. Users can type snarky messages that then play for their friends. This is my final project at the Iron Yard coding academy.

#### Features:
* User authentication
* User profiles including points earned and avatar accessories
* Mutual friending system/search
* Messaging
 - User types a short message (14 syllables or fewer) and picks a message theme
 - User previews message which has a song/animation created based on the syllable count of the message
 - Users earn points for sending or receiving messages

#### Languages/Libraries/Frameworks:
* HTML/CSS/Sass
* JavaScript ES2015
* jQuery
* React.js
* Howler.js

#### API/External Support:
* baas.kinvey for user/friend/message data
* dropbox.com for sound hosting
* surge.sh for web hosting

#### Future Goals:
* Messages can be overlaid on an image or video
* Utilizing web-based sound manipulation packages to avoid importing hard-written sound files
* Advanced syllable algorithm to avoid awkward melody pairings
* Exclusive message themes based on location, timing, or other arbitrary qualifiers
* Emoji support

#### Other Stuff:
* Sound files were created and compressed primarily using Ableton 9 with Komplete 9
* Animations are rendered client-side using CSS
